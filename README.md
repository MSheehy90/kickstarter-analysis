# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Comparing successful, failed and canceled campaigns by launch date and fundraising goal.

### Purpose

Determine the best launch date and goal range.

## Analysis and Challenges



The successful, failed and canceled campaigns were summed by month to view data ranges with the best outcome. When reviewing the launch date, we can clearly see a peak in successful campaigns. Although we see more successful campaigns in a certain month, we also see a rise in failed campaigns. We mush look at the ratio of successful and failed campaigns to determine best change of success.

The campaign outcomes were summed by goal ranges and the percentage of success and failed data was compared. When reviewing goal ranges, the data does not skew towards either a lower or higher ranges for success.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The data tells us there have been the most campaigns launched in the summer. Although both the successful and failed campaigns have risen between June through August, the ratio of successful campaigns outweigh the failed campaigns. Launch between June and August, with June having the highest ratio for success.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We can look at the chart to see at what points the lines cross to determine ranges that are favorable and less favorable. In the chart we see more success with ranges between $0 to $19,999 and $35,000 to $49,999.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Charts can help us interpret data but does not tell the full story. For example, when looking at the launch dates, we can see a peak in July and may assume this is the best launch date but would need to look at the failed data and also determine the lowest point in relation to the months with higher success rates. Aslo when pulling the data, I inadvertently entered the greater sign instead of the equal to or greater than and my grand total was incorrect. Had I not double checked my work by spot checking/filtering the data tab, I would have worked with incorrect data. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The month with the highest successful outcome is July with 109 campaigns. 
The month with the best chances of a successful outcome is June with 101 successful campaigns and 45 failed campaigns (5 less failed campaigns than July).

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

When looking at the scale from $0 to $50,000, the successful campaigns are not neccessarily the lowest goal. Although we see higher percentage of success declining, we see the data begin to rise at $25,000 and shift into a higher probabilty of success at $35,000 to $44,999. We must look at more factors to better understand the goal ranges. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The data tells us the highest pledged total but does not tell us the source or who is contributing. We do not know if funding is based on popularity of the campaign or if there are preexisting connections with the organizers and the backers.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Some other graphs we can create is a bar or column graph of the launch date and an area graph for the date ranges.
